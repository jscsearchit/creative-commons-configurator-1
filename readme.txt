== Description ==

[Creative-Commons-Configurator](http://www.g-loaded.eu/2006/01/14/creative-commons-configurator-wordpress-plugin/ "Official Creative-Commons-Configurator Homepage") is the only tool a user will ever need in order to set a [Creative Commons License](http://creativecommons.org/) on a WordPress blog and control the inclusion or display of the license information and relevant metadata into the blog pages or the syndication feeds. All configuration is done via a page in the administration panel. Template tags are also available for those who need complete customization.

Features at a glance:

- Configuration page in the WordPress administration panel. No manual editing of files is needed for basic usage.
- License selection by using the web-based license selection API from CreativeCommons.org.
- The license information can be reset at any time. This action also removes the options that are stored in the WordPress database.
- Adds license information to:
 - The HTML head area (Not visible to human visitors).
 - The Atom, RSS 2.0 and RDF (RSS 1.0) feeds through the Creative Commons RSS module, which validates properly. This option is compatible only with WordPress 2 or newer due to technical reasons.
 - Displays a block with license information under the published content. Basic customization (license information and formatting) is available through the configuration panel.
- Some template tags are provided for use in your theme templates.
- The plugin is ready for localization.
